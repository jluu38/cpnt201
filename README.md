## Summary

- The nose, mouth, and right eye paths got merged - unfortunately made it difficult to play with colour schemes.
- Night Mode and Fun Mode are alternative colour schemes
  - Night inverts the entire page's colours
  - Fun, clears the background, adjusts strokes, and gives the dot an animation property.
  - Had difficulties applying filters to specific paths in fun mode for some reason -- see CSS.
- SVG in images folder just in case
